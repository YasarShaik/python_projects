# Python Projects!
As I start to develop interests towards AI and ML, this repository wil mark my first few steps that i take towards it.
This repository will hold almost all the projects that I make using Python. From the very basic `` print() ``  and ``input()`` to Flask and NumPy.This repo will help me navigate through my learning, and it'll help you to look at it.

Python has become the go-to language for AI and Machine Learning, and for good reason. Its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries make it far more accessible than lower-level languages like C, C++, or Java, especially for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
Whether you're aiming for a career in AI/ML or simply exploring the field out of curiosity, Python offers a smooth learning curve and powerful tools to bring your ideas to life. This repository showcases my journey through Python, featuring projects that span foundational concepts to more advanced applications.

I aim to develop atleast a **100 projects developed using Python** for this purpose, they might be unique, they might be the best but also they might be adopted, they might be smthng a five year old could do, and smthng that turns out extremely disastrous.
But still, I will try my best through this journey.
