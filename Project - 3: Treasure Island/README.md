## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

This game blends several core Python concepts into a fun, immersive experience:

- **Multiline strings with `r'''...'''`**: Used to display ASCII art.
- **`print()` and `input()` functions**: For user interaction and narrative flow.
- **Variables**: Like `name`, `opt1`, `opt2`, and `opt3` to store user choices.
- **Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)**: To control the storyâ€™s branching paths.
- **String comparison and logic**: Case-insensitive checks for user input.
- **âœ… f-strings**: For dynamic storytelling with personalized messages.
